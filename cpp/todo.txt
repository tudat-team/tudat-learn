To do:
- Release vs Debug
- Maybe Estimator shouldn't have fit(), only regressors, classifiers and clustering. This way we can introduce
reinforcement learning techniques, for instance(?).
- Virtual destructors on base classes! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/461203/when-to-use-virtual-destructors
- Scaler output if integer dataset.
- Make tudat-learn header only?
- Scaler::transform(Datum) needs to be included in tests.
- shared_ptr< T > might need to be changed to shared_ptr< const T > in some situations, to prevent classes from altering datasets.
- change indices vectors from vector<int> to vector<size_t>
